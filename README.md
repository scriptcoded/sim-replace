## About
sim-replace, or Simultaneous Replace, is a small utilty that will execute mutliple regex replaces simultaneously.

## Installation

Install via Yarn (recommended):
```bash
yarn add sim-replace -D
```
Install via NPM:
```bash
npm install sim-replace --save-dev
```

## Usage
Note that we're using ES6 import statements here. Usage with `require` works just as well.


```javascript
import simReplace from 'sim-replace'

let text = 'There was a cow and a cat'

let result = simReplace(text, [
  [/cow/g, 'cat'],
  [/cat/g, 'cow']
])

result === 'There was a cat and a cow' // true
```

It also supports capturing group placeholders

```javascript
import simReplace from 'sim-replace'

let text = 'This is my sister'

let result = simReplace(text, [
  [/(my sister)/g, 'Fanny, $1']
])

result === 'This is Fanny, my sister' // true
```

## Known issues
- Regex with multiple matches doesn't work.
